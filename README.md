## Project Description

### General Opportunity & Motivation
 Online shopping has progressively become one of the most popular online activities worldwide, with retail e-commerce sales amounting to a staggering 4.28 trillion US dollars. However, even though people are buying more, local businesses are struggling to connect with consumers. 

 When COVID-19 shut our cities down in the Spring of 2020, there was an accelerated shift towards conscious consumerism, where individuals didn’t just want to shop - they wanted to “do good” while they shopped. Conscious consumerism, more specifically, is the idea that people are driven to make ethical purchase decisions that have a positive social, economic, or environmental impact. A key way in which individuals do this is by shopping locally - a trend that surged during the pandemic. Members of our group alike were a part of this societal trend. By shopping locally, we knew we were investing in our communities, creating demand for local jobs, and reducing our overall carbon footprint - and that made us feel good. As an added benefit, we found unique, quality products that we wouldn’t have found elsewhere online. Nevertheless, as life slowly transitions to a mild normality, the momentum “shopping local” previously had is beginning to die, with big tech continuing to offer easier and more convenient ways to connect consumers to products. Therefore, we realize that local stores are in dire need of new avenues to connect with consumers and sell their products. On the other hand, individuals (including members of our team) are looking for ways to continue their practice of “conscious consumerism”.

### Our Proposal
Our team wants to build a website that helps put a spotlight on the thousands of unique, local, small businesses that exist in our surrounding Austin community. We want to help small businesses voice their stories and attract new customers, while making it easier for consumers to find and support our local establishments. In essence, our website will contain a collection of small Austin businesses with information about their products, story, physical locations, and eCommerce platform.

### Our Implementation 
Validated HTML pages and CSS were used to structure the overall foundation and design of the website. Javascript was used for front end form verification to verify user's information when they registered. Dynamic HTML features were used for password and username requirements on the login page, and jQuery was used throughout. PHP was used throughout the site, but primarily to process login/register data being entered, as well as for the contact-us message form. To access all of the store and product information we used PHP interfaced to MySQL. Our PHP script grabs information from the database and displays it on the page as HTML. PHP also works to filter items in the explore page by accessing the database and extracting the filtered stores. Cookies are set and read to maintain the state of a user log in, even after the tab is closed. AJAX was used for login sessions and posting, as well as across the site for user searching. Mostly all interactions to PHP files are done with XMLHTTPRequest or other AJAX related functions. Promotional videos/audo files for brand's were embedded within our website as well.
